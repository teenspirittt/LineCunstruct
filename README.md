# LineCunstruct"Generating vectors"

1. Specify the start and end of the line segment in any way.

2. Using different colors, draw the line segments using the asymmetric CDA and Bresenham methods. Pause between the construction of the segments.

3. Draw the "real" line in a different color.

4. Compare the algorithms of CDA and Bresenham. Give examples of their similarities and differences.
